(re.sonny.Retro:2): Gjs-CRITICAL **: 12:51:42.482: Attempting to run a JS callback during garbage collection. This is most likely caused by destroying a Clutter actor or GTK widget with ::destroy signal connected, or using the destroy(), dispose(), or remove() vfuncs. Because it would crash the application, it has been blocked.

(re.sonny.Retro:2): Gjs-CRITICAL **: 12:51:42.482: The offending callback was SourceFunc().
